* Gradient descent
* Convex optimization 
* Markov chain Monte Carlo

Once you know what your objective function is it's easy to find an optimizer for it in most situations. We can even use objective functions as a tool to shape the kind of behavior we want. For example we could have an objective function be responsible

I Have more ideas from this in the representation theory blog post
