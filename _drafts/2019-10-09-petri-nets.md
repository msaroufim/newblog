Can model any process like this and study the steady state behavior

Combines ideas from bayesian inference, systems biology etc..

Translate syntax of a network into its semantics, it's meaning within a specific application

Symmetric monoidal category shows up a lot

Systems modeling
Systems thinking

Different fields use network diagrams but they don't know when their results generalize to other fields unless they work at a higher layer of abstraction.

Tools to represent problems
* Systems thinking for dynamical systems and bayesian networks
* Optimization to find missing values

Petri nets can be composed to form open dynamical systems (what does open mean here?)

Terminlogy that shows up a lot
* lax monoidal category
* cospan

A lot of stuff looks like circuits
* Electric circuits
* Control networks
* Neural networks
* Graph databases
* Computation

I first read it when I was working on a real time strategy game and wanted some help to decide how to balance resources and their various production mechanims. Loads of diagrams that make this kind of thinking really obvious if you've ever played any strategy game
