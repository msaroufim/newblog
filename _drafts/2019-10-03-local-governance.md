And if we have a bunch of people sharing a common valuable resource, it seems eventual that one of them will get greedy and overexploit that resource which will cause everyone to either quickly use up the common resource or become violent. This is called "The Tragedy of the Commons". It was proposed by 

It's very related to Bitcoin 

A first attempt at modeling common pool resource problems would be to use a framework like the Prisonners dilemma which is a classical result in Game theory where we model the decision that two caught criminals need to make. Do they betray each other or do they both stay silent?

If both prisoners know the rules of the game and are rational then they'll both opt to staying quiet since it's what minimizes the total amount of regret accross both of them. However, there's a lot of evidence


We generally think of rules as only being enforcable by a central authority which deals out appropriate punishment to offenders.



Hobbe's Levianthan is often required reading in most schools and it says in a roundabount manner that there is a tradeoff between the security and liberty that a citizen can expect. You can only expect perfect safety in an autocratic society where there is no individual liberty.

There are a few issues with the Levianthan way of thinking
1. Central authorities can't be all knowing and all benevolent
2. It's still possible to have both security and liberty without a central authority

However, it's easy to forget that the large countries we have today were all formed fairly recently and before then were composed of a bunch of different communities that have evolved ways to cooperate over the use of common resources without resorting to a central authority.

There are 3 core problems that need to be solved by negotiating parties to avoid "The Tragedy of the Commons".
1. Supply
2. Credible commitment
3. Mutual monitoring


## Supply

It's hard to argue over abundant resources so for the most part communities will negotiate around scarce resources. Scarce is also not a definition that simply applies to a point in time but instead it applies to the lifetime of a resource. Some things we'd need to look at here are
1. Is the resource renewable? And if so how much effort does it take to renew it?
2. Is the resource cyclical such as agricultural produce?
3. Does the resource require a lot of refining


Is a punishment fair if an act is done in desparation? Rules need to be revised by those with skin in the game to be sustainable and fair.

Design principles of long enduring Common Pool Resource institutions
1. Clearly defined boundaries on time, space and amount of resource extraction
2. Boundaries need to be grounded in the reality of the environment
3. Rules can change if they have issues
4. Shared accountability: enforcers are formed from local rotations
5. Repeat offenders get sanctioned exponentially more
6. Local conflict resolution process
7. Right not be challenged by external authorities

Principles here, have a picture for each


Entrepreneurship is a way to avoid zero sum games
Local governance needs to be fractal to be sustainable - this is terminology I'm borrowing from Mandelbrot and Taleb.

## Bitcoin

So far we've been talking about Common Pool Resources in the context of fixed resources such as gold, water, cattle etc. But if we extend our definition to include currency then we'll see how Bitcoin has all of the design principles that would make it a long enduring common resource pool institution.

Wars are expensive and are funded by printing money which is impossible to do with Bitcoin.

## Prisoner's dilemma

## Supply analysis
Can be extremely complicated or simple like in the case of Bitcoin. When it's extremely complex we need a different toolkit to make sense of what will happen to the supply when we look at Dynamical systems and how to make policy decisions based on them.
