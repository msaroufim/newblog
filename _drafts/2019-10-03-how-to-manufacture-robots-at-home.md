# How to manufacture robots at home

# 3D printing

Different materials
Find files online
Use software like TinkerCad to get base models and change them

# Circuits

Arduino  + rasberry pi as the brains
To learn circuits
* Build your own PC - r/masterrace
* Read electronics book
* Robot bohnanza
* Look at DYI electronic repairs on youtube
    * fixit guy
    * Ben Eater build a CPU from scratch
    * Linus tech tips

* Next time an old piece of electronics starts failing, take it apart, see if you can fix and if not just identify what the different parts are
* Arduino has open source files, read the Arduino spec and see what's up
* PID controllers
* SLAM algorithms


Best way to learn in a new domain is to just copy stuff that works

Need a diagram of Arduino, robot and program

Even an IC can be reverse engineeered with the help of Google and a microscope but at that point you need to invest in an electronics lab which unfortunately I'm also just starting to piece together. [Reading Silicon: How to reverse engineer IC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHx-XUA6f9g) goes into a lot more detail
